PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This program is a reproduction of John Conway's "Game of Life." This is a "game" with no players in which a board 
(represented by a two-dimensional array) contains cells that are either on or off. At each time step, certain rules 
govern what happens to these cells; their birth, life, and death.



RUN EXAMPLE:
exe/./PC02 test5.txt 500 test5.out

USAGE:
exe/./PC02 INPUT_FILE GENERATION_AMOUNTS OUTPUT_FILE

INPUT_FILE         = file with initial life objects on board
GENERATION_AMOUNTS = amount of generations that the game should run
OUTPUT_FILE        = where to save the final gameboard after all generations are run
